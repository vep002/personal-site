          <h2>A little about me</h2>
          <p>Before I became a welder I had dreams of working a trade job - a solid and tangible skill that I could take anywhere - but as a woman I didn't think the trades were accessible to me. But, after years of working a job I hated, I decided to quit my job and fight my way into the welding field, social norms and gender roles be damned. Welding has been an incredible experience for me: it has taught me that I am capable of so much more than I previously thought and I have gained so much confidence in my own abilities. Also, just knowing that I can walk into a shop as the only woman and lay a weld bead just as well as anyone else there gives me such immense pride. However, the lifestyle of a welder (up before the sun, back breaking labor, and no social life to speak of, and relatively low pay) are not so appealing, and now Iâ€™m looking for something different. The leap from welding and metal fabrication to software development might seem like a big one to most people, but to me the two are incredibly connected. I see coding as an extension of welding, both are skilled trades that are highly logical and procedural, and both had previously seemed like fields that were out of my grasp. Now I know what I'm capable of, and I know that I can tackle coding just as fiercely as I tackled welding. </p>
